# Week 3 - Project 2

## About

This is my submission for Week 3 - Project 2 for Harvard Extension School's CSCI-E 15 Dynamic Web Applications.

## Requirements

- XAMPP or MAMP

## How to Run

I used XAMPP for this Project as a local host.

- Once you download XAMPP, you need to download/clone this project into a folder called 'htdocs' which can be found within the location where you downloaded XAMPP.
- Open XAMPP and under actions click start on both Apache and MySQL modules.
- Now open your a web browser, and go to the address: http://localhost/project_two

## Live Demo

- This project can also be found at: http://pranaymarella.me/project_two/
